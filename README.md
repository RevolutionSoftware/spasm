# SPASM
The fastest Z80 assembler with extra features supporting TI calculator development
df
SPASM is a z80 assembler with extra features to support development for TI calculators.
SPASM was written not to add another generic tool to the oversaturated assembler "marketplace",
but to actually do something different. We needed a fast assembler. TASM wasn't cutting it.

When you're impatient, you debug often, or are writing too much code for other assemblers to handle,
this assembler is your new best friend!
